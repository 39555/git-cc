![GitHub go.mod Go version](https://img.shields.io/github/go-mod/go-version/skalt/git-cc)
![Go report card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/skalt/git-cc)

## Usage

![demo](./assets/demo.gif)

```sh
# you can invoke either of the below to
# interactively write a conventional commit
git cc
git cc feat          # start after the commit-type
git cc 'feat(scope)' # start after the scope

# or validate your conventional commit
git cc feat: added conventional commits # ok! creates a commit
git cc 'feat(cli): added a conventional commit' # ok! creates a commit
git cc feat add a typo  # starts interaction at the scope
git cc -m "invalid(stuff): should return 1"
```

### Configuration

See [`./commit_convention.yml`](./commit_convention.yml) for an example configuration file.

## Why write conventional commits through an interactive CLI?

Figuring out what to write for an informative commit can be difficult.
The conventional commits standard helps figure out what to write.
As a bonus, conventional commits facilitate generating changelogs and semantic version increments.
An interactive command-line application helps with following the standard.

## Installation

### Manual installation

Go to [the project releases page][releases page] to download the appropriate packaging format.
Please verify the shasum of the downloaded executable for you before you run it.

### Using `brew`

```sh
brew tap skalt/git-cc
brew install git-cc
```

### Using the installer script for Linux or Mac

First, take a second to verify that the installer script would correctly check the shasum of the downloaded package.
Then, run the following commands:

<!-- TODO: automate populating outputs with `cog` or similar -->

```sh
repo=skalt/git-cc
branch=master
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/$repo/$branch/scripts/install.sh > /tmp/install.sh
shasum -a 256 /tmp/install.sh | sed 's/^/# /g'
# 805354a9b0db5648af785086af5a4af036d5281ea5999bda055c888186d36cd7  /tmp/install.sh
```

```sh
chmod +x /tmp/install.sh
/tmp/install.sh --help | sed 's/^/# /g'
# USAGE: ./install.sh [-h|--help] [--download-only|--dry-run] [FMT]
# download a release of git-cc for your OS and instruction set architecture.
#
# ARGS:
#   -h|--help        print this message and exit
#   --download-only  download as FMT, but do not install
#   --dry-run        print rather than follow the download url for the binary
#   FMT              The download format. Valid values are
#                      - tar.gz (default)
#                      - apk
#                      - brew
#                      - deb
#                      - exe
#                      - rpm
```

```sh
/tmp/install.sh
```

### From source with go

To compile from source, run `make install` inside the source directory.
You'll need to have a `go >= 1.19` toolchain and to have your `$GOPATH/bin` on your `$PATH`.

```sh
git clone git@bitbucket.org
```
